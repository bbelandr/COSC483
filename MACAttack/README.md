# Introduction
This program implements the SHA1 algorithm as described in the [FIPS 180-3](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) specification.
There are two major parts of this project; the first is implementing SHA1, and the second is conducting a MAC attack on the implemented SHA1 algorithm.

# Compilation Steps
There should already be a makefile within this directory. `make` should compile and `make run` should both compile and run the program.
